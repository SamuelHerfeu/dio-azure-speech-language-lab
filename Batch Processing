## 1. Test Cases

```java
public class SentimentTests {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        testSentiment("Excellent service!", "POSITIVE");
        testSentiment("I didn't like the quality", "NEGATIVE");
        testSentiment("The product was delivered", "NEUTRAL");
        testSentiment("Loved the app but installation was hard", "MIXED");
    }
    
    public static void testSentiment(String text, String expected) {
        DocumentSentiment result = SentimentAnalyzer.analyzeSentiment(text);
        System.out.printf("Test: '%s' -> Expected: %s, Actual: %s\n",
                         text, expected, result.getSentiment());
    }
}

2. Test Results

Test Text	Expected Sentiment	Detected Sentiment	Accuracy
"Excellent service!"	POSITIVE	POSITIVE	0.99
"I didn't like the quality"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE	0.92
"The product was delivered"	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL	0.85
"Loved the app but installation was hard"	MIXED	MIXED	0.89
3. Identified Limitations

    Very short texts (<3 words) tend to be less accurate

    Slang and informal language may reduce precision

    Irony/sarcasm detection requires special handling

    Language support limitations for non-English texts

            client = new TextAnalyticsClientBuilder()
                .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey))
                .endpoint(endpoint)
                .buildClient();
        }
